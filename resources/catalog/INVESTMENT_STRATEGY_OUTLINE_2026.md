# Investment Strategy Outline 2026

## Strategy pillars
1. **Quality growth**: prioritize cash-flow-positive issuers with durable advantages.
2. **Yield stability**: ladder fixed-income exposure to reduce duration shocks.
3. **Risk overlays**: use drawdown controls and macro hedges in stressed regimes.

## Signal framework
- Valuation: forward earnings yield relative to rate corridor
- Momentum: 6–12 month relative strength
- Macro: inflation trend and liquidity conditions

## Rebalancing rules
- Rebalance when allocation deviates ±5% from target
- Risk-off trigger: 20% drawdown or volatility spike above 15%
- Opportunistic buys: 10% correction with improving liquidity
