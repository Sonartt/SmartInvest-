# Logs Directory

This directory is for application log files only.

**Note:** The following files should NOT be in this directory and appear to be misplaced source code:
- `0ath-token.ts`
- `C2Bvalidation.js`
- `confirmationendpoint.ts`
- `realSTKpush.ts`

These files should be moved to appropriate source directories:
- TypeScript files (.ts) should be in `src/` or appropriate service directories
- JavaScript files (.js) should be in `api/` or `services/` directories

Only `.log` files and `.gitkeep` should remain in this directory.
