## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS

### 4.1 Risk Identification
Risks identified through:
- Regular brainstorming sessions (quarterly)
- Business unit self-assessments (annual)
- Incident and loss analysis
- Industry and peer benchmarking
- Regulatory change monitoring
- Customer and supplier feedback
- Process mapping and review
- Emerging risks monitoring

### 4.2 Risk Analysis
For each identified risk:

**Likelihood Assessment:**
- Almost Certain (80-100%)
- Likely (60-80%)
- Possible (40-60%)
- Unlikely (20-40%)
- Rare (0-20%)

**Impact Assessment:**
- Catastrophic: > KES 50 million or existential threat
- Major: KES 10-50 million or significant business impact
- Moderate: KES 1-10 million or notable impact
- Minor: < KES 1 million or limited impact
- Negligible: Immaterial impact

### 4.3 Risk Rating
| Likelihood | Catastrophic | Major | Moderate | Minor | Negligible |
|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Almost Certain** | Critical | High | High | Medium | Low |
| **Likely** | High | High | Medium | Medium | Low |
| **Possible** | High | Medium | Medium | Low | Low |
| **Unlikely** | Medium | Medium | Low | Low | Negligible |
| **Rare** | Medium | Low | Low | Negligible | Negligible |

**Risk Scoring:** Likelihood × Impact = Risk Score

## 5. RISK APPETITE & TOLERANCE

### 5.1 Risk Appetite
SmartInvest's risk appetite by category:

| Category | Appetite | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Strategic** | Medium | Innovation supported with governance |
| **Operational** | Low | Business continuity critical |
| **Financial** | Low-Medium | Conservative with growth opportunities |
| **Compliance** | Very Low | Regulatory violations intolerable |
| **Cybersecurity** | Low | Customer data protection paramount |
| **Reputational** | Low | Brand value critical to success |

### 5.2 Risk Tolerance
- **Critical Risks:** Must have mitigation plan before acceptance
- **High Risks:** Require executive approval for acceptance
- **Medium Risks:** Department head approval sufficient
- **Low Risks:** Routine operational decisions
- **Negligible:** No special governance needed

### 5.3 Risk Acceptance Process
For risks requiring acceptance:
1. Business case documenting need
2. Identified mitigation strategies
3. Approval authority sign-off
4. Board notification (if critical)
5. Regular monitoring thereafter

---

## 6. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### 6.1 Four Response Options

**Avoid:** Eliminate the risk by not pursuing activity
- When: Risk outweighs potential benefit
- Example: Exiting risky market or product line
- Cost: Lost opportunities
- Effectiveness: Highest (eliminates risk)

**Mitigate:** Reduce likelihood or impact
- When: Risk manageable through controls
- Example: Cybersecurity investments
- Cost: Control implementation investment
- Effectiveness: Significant (most common)

**Accept:** Tolerate the risk with no action
- When: Cost of mitigation exceeds benefit
- Example: Low-impact operational risks
- Cost: Absorbed loss if risk occurs
- Effectiveness: Minimal (risk remains)

**Transfer:** Shift risk to third party
- When: Economical alternative exists
- Example: Insurance, outsourcing
- Cost: Transfer/insurance premiums
- Effectiveness: High (if effective transfer)

### 6.2 Mitigation Planning
For mitigation approach, develop:
- **Owner:** Responsible executive
- **Timeline:** Implementation schedule
- **Resources:** Required investment
- **Controls:** Specific mitigating actions
- **Metric:** Success/effectiveness measure
- **Status:** Current progress tracking
- **Contingency:** Backup if primary fails

### 6.3 Control Testing
Controls verified through:
- **Design Testing:** Are controls well-designed?
- **Operating Effectiveness:** Do controls work as designed?
- **Frequency:** Annually (critical), periodically (others)
- **Documentation:** Evidence of control operation
- **Remediation:** Corrective action for failures
