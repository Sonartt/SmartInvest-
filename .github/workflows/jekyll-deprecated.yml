# This file disables the Jekyll workflow
# The SmartInvest Africa project is a Node.js/Express application, not a Jekyll site.
# If you need to re-enable Jekyll, delete this file and restore jekyll-docker.yml

# To completely remove the Jekyll workflow from GitHub:
# 1. Delete .github/workflows/jekyll-docker.yml from the main branch
# 2. This will prevent the workflow from running on new PRs
